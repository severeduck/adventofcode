# Advent of Code: Programming Languages Plan

A different language for each day of the event:

1. [**Day 1: Python**](tasks/day1/solution.py) - Start with something straightforward and versatile.
2. [**Day 2: JavaScript**](tasks/day2/solution.js) - Great for its ubiquity and flexibility.
3. [**Day 3: Java**](tasks/day3/solution.java) - A strong, statically typed language, good for object-oriented programming challenges.
4. [**Day 4: C++**](tasks/day4/solution.cpp) - Ideal for performance-intensive problems.
5. [**Day 5: Ruby**](tasks/day5/solution.rb) - Focus on elegant syntax and quick scripting capabilities.
6. [**Day 6: Swift**](tasks/day6/aoc_2023_day6/GameViewController.swift) - Leverage your existing skills in a familiar language.
7. [**Day 7: Go**](tasks/day7/main.go) - For its simplicity and efficient concurrency handling.
8. [**Day 8: Rust**](tasks/day8/solution.rs) - Safe memory management and performance.
9. [**Day 9: PHP**] - Widely used in web development, offering a different perspective.
10. [**Day 10: Kotlin**] - Modern language, great for concise and expressive code.
11. [**Day 11: Scala**] - Functional programming features on the JVM.
12. [**Day 12: C#**] - Powerful for various applications, with robust library support.
13. [**Day 13: Haskell**] - Pure functional programming for a different challenge.
14. [**Day 14: TypeScript**] - JavaScript with static type-checking.
15. [**Day 15: Perl**] - Text processing and system administration tasks.
16. [**Day 16: Lua**] - Lightweight and embeddable scripting language.
17. [**Day 17: Clojure**] - A modern take on Lisp, emphasizing immutability and functional programming.
18. [**Day 18: R**] - Great for any data analysis or statistical challenges.
19. [**Day 19: Groovy**] - Agile and dynamic language for the Java platform.
20. [**Day 20: Objective-C**] - A different flavor of C, especially for those familiar with Apple ecosystems.
21. [**Day 21: Erlang**] - For its unique approach to concurrency and distributed systems.
22. [**Day 22: Elixir**] - Built on the Erlang VM, known for its scalability and maintainability.
23. [**Day 23: F#**] - Functional-first language for .NET applications.
24. [**Day 24: Dart**] - Optimized for UI development, used for Flutter.
25. [**Day 25: Julia**] - High-performance language for technical computing.
